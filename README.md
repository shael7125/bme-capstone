This repository contains the CircuitPy code I wrote for my BME capstone device. The device integrates the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (the principal microcontroller) and the Sprint-IR-W CO2 sensor, and simultaneously captures capnography (etCO2) and actigraphy (accelaration) data. These data are then stored in a .txt file on the Flash memory of the principal microcontroller. 

This code.py was written to the principal microcontroller (which is wired to the Sprint CO2 sensor) over a serial port to create the embedded sensor device detailed above.
